<h3><em>I can't login to Facebook</em></h3>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Since this application runs within the browser you are probably already connected to Facebook. This a problem when logging in the first time. Please visit in your mobile browser m.facebook.com and log out (bottom page somewhere). Afterwards revisit the application and log in through Facebook, once connected you can use the application. Enjoy ;).</p>
